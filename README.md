# `grdn`

A simple protocol for [garden-style][garden] content feeds: designed from the start for evergreen content which grows and develops over time, with first-class support for updates and changes. For background, see [this (garden-style!) essay][feeds-not-fit], and the many things it links to.

This is not a competitor to RSS, Atom, or JSON Feed. It is a complement, designed for a different kind of content.

> **Note** This is currently in the earliest possible stages of development. You're welcome to follow along, but expect changes!
